## About 
A Minecraft 1.12.2 kitchen sink modpack made by Fridge, made for use in a private discord server. 
DOES NOT WORK WITH BEDROCK! Even on the Windows 10 Edition.

## Setup
1. Install forge 1.12.2 [here.](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)
2. Press the green download button and extract the .zip, the option should pop up if you right click the folder.
3. Ctrl + C (Windows) or CMD + C (Mac) on the folder.

We will now move the folder, so minecraft can use our mods. YOU DON'T NEED TO MOVE THE README, OR THE VERSIONS.MD. ONLY THE MODS FOLDER.

The following instructions depend on your OS.

### Windows

- Press Windows + R at the same time.
- Type in %appdata% into the prompt.
- Look for Minecraft, and double click into the folder.
- Paste the mods (Ctrl + X) into the folder.

### MacOS

- Open Finder.
- Press CMD + Shift + G.
- Type in this directory: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/
- Find the mods folder, if it doesn't exist, create the folder.
- Paste the folder.

## Setup (Continued)

4. Go to the Minecraft Launcher
5. Make sure the forge installation is chosen, (it has an anvil logo on it)
6. Click Play

## Updating

To update, you must delete the old version of your folder in the Minecraft folder, and then follow the instructions for setup.

## Issues

In the issues tab you may either reccomend a mod or post an issue with a mod. Make sure you have a Github Account though.
