# Versioning

Versioning will work as X.Y.Z (e.g. 1.12.2) 

## X

X denotes a major update, I'd say 10 or so mods have been added to the modpack, non-backwards compatible

## Y 

Y denotes a minor, update, only a couple mods added. The mods are not client-side, so non-backwards compatible

## Z

Z denotes a miniscule update, not much changes to the game. The mods added are client-side, so it is backwards compatible, and not essential to play on the aternos server.

## How To Update

1. Go to Releases
2. Draft a new release
3. Choose the appropriate version name
4. Version Title
5. Description if necesscary
6. Make 'releases' the target branch
7. Release
